This directory contains an iteratively developed library of tools, structures, and utilities to help solve successive days.

Last year, I had created the following utilities:
* array
* assert
* grid
* linkedlist
* maputil
* mathutil
* queue
* stack

Some of these, like the queue and stack, weren't used during the challenges but were fun to implement.  Others, like grid and array, were used extensively.

This year, I'll likely benefit from an improved grid/plane module to handle various movements, iterations, navigation, adjacent-element-logic, and transformations.
